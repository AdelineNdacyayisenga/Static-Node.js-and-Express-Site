           p I am Adeline. Thank you for visiting my portifolio. I have always been interested in making an impact and technology has opened my eyes to how much of an impact I can have by building applications to help businesses develop and run efficiently. With a background in Data Analytics, I decided to pursue software engineering, to be part of the team that implements the change, to support many people around the world. I enjoy learning and I am excited for this journey to become a Full Stack Javascript Developer.
